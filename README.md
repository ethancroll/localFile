# localFile

## plan:

- have a host compter running on the local network
- have a qr code or url to get to that website on another device
- be able to upload files to that
- show all the files in the assigned folder so client device can download as well

## how to use it:

- npm i
- npm start

### note

- you will likely have to diable the firewall on your host computer
